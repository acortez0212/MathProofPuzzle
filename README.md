This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

This key will be used for the AI-generated mathematical proof puzzles.

### Run the development server

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features

- Create mathematical proofs manually by adding each step
- Generate mathematical proofs automatically using OpenAI's o3-mini model
- Arrange proof steps as a puzzle game
- LaTeX support for mathematical expressions

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
